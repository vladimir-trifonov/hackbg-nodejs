So someone will tweet or post on a link on Reddit to one of many uneneding &#x27;long form&#x27; articles published by one of many popular sites such as Vox, Salon, etc. The problem is these huge articles are sometimes a chore to read, and you have to wade through pages of historical and philisophical preface before you get to the substance. It&#x27;s like there &#x27;s an article about American&#x27;s obcession with speed, but before I can get to the heart of the matter or the author&#x27;s personal take or solution, I first have to read through 500 years of history and what philosophers and historians thought of the issue. It&#x27;s like an infomercial where the host goes on about the problem that the trinket is supposed to solve and then in the last 5 minutes mentions the trinket. If something is unique and interesting there is no need to embellish it with 2000 words of introductory prose. And then even if the premise of the article is interesting, reading 4000 words of fluff will make me too tired to want to learn more.",

One set identifies the user and the other set contains their day to day activities. It&#x27;s actually quite creepy the way some of these players crosslink their services and share login credentials.
